# Akash Community

Akash Network is supported by a diverse group of users, contributors, and supporters. Together, we strive to improve the project and work together efficiently. We're proud of our progress over the years. All aspects of the Akash Network - from code to culture - are managed by the community and divided into three programs:

| |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Core Community Groups](core-groups) | Core community groups are responsible for contributing code, writing documentation, testing product features and reporting bugs, organizing meetups and suggesting ideas for new features and various other activities that evolve the Akash Network. |
| [Akash Insiders](insiders) | Akash Insiders are global leaders and influencers in the web3 space. They support our community by moderating Akash social channels, organizing and attending online and in-person events, and creating technical and non-technical educational content. |
| [Akash EDU](edu) | Akash EDU aims to provide world-class web3 education, along with certificates to showcase course completion and achievements. |
